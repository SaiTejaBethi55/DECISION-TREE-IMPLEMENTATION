##I implemented a Decision Tree, a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression, which works by splitting data into branches based on conditions and producing predictions at the leaf nodes. For this task, I selected an appropriate dataset and performed preprocessing, which included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. I used Scikit-learn’s DecisionTreeClassifier to train the model, tuning hyperparameters such as max_depth, min_samples_split, and the criterion (Gini Index or Entropy) to optimize performance. Once the model was trained, I visualized the tree using Graphviz to clearly illustrate how decisions were made at each node and how the features influenced the outcomes. I evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix to assess its classification performance. Decision Trees are widely applicable, and I explored its utility in scenarios such as healthcare for disease diagnosis, finance for credit risk assessment, marketing for customer segmentation, and education for predicting student performance. One of the main advantages of this approach is that it is highly interpretable and requires minimal preprocessing, while it also handles both numerical and categorical features efficiently. However, I ensured to control overfitting by limiting the tree depth, as deep trees tend to memorize the data, reducing their performance on unseen samples. The deliverable for this task includes a Jupyter Notebook containing all steps: dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, visualization, and performance evaluation with analysis. By completing this project, I successfully demonstrated my ability to build and evaluate a Decision Tree, interpret its decisions, and provide a clear visualization that highlights how the model arrives at predictions, which are essential skills for practical machine learning applications.
